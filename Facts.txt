In spring boot, I learned about:
    1. How tomcat is embedded in spring boot application. It can be turned off using spring.main.web-application-type=none.
    2. @SpringBootApplication annotation is a combination of @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan.
    3. @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation is used to enable Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration mechanism. It tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
    4. @ComponentScan annotation is used to tell Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the hello package, allowing it to find the controllers.
    5. @RestController annotation is used to create RESTful web services. It is a convenience annotation that does nothing more than adding the @Controller and @ResponseBody annotations.
    6. @RequestMapping annotation is used to map web requests to Spring Controller methods.
    7. @RequestBody annotation is used to bind the HTTP request body with a domain object in method parameter or return type.
    8. record is a handy class in Java 14. It is a compact way to create a class with getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods.
    9. @SequenceGenerator annotation is used to generate a sequence of numbers.
    10. @GeneratedValue annotation is used to specify the primary key generation strategy

    I also learned about:
        1. The package name should be in lower case with no underscores, hyphens, or spaces.
        2. How @Component(value = "myBean") annotation is used to create a bean with the name myBean, it comes in handy when you want to create multiple beans of the same type.
        3. How @Qualifier annotation is used to resolve the conflict when multiple beans of the same type are available in the Spring container.
        4. How @Primary annotation is used to tell Spring to use this bean when multiple candidates are available. This is useful when you have multiple implementations of the same interface and you want to use one of them as the primary bean.
